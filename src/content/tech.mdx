# The Sovereign Source Manifesto

**2G-First Design**: We optimize for the lowest common denominator of Haitian connectivity. If a page doesn't load on an Edge network in a rural communal section, it is a bug.

**Professional Accountability**: Every municipal official is linked to a verified Vwa profile, turning local governance into a professional career path.

**Data Sovereignty**: Built with BSL 1.1, this platform ensures that Haitian municipal data belongs to the municipality, not foreign commercial entities.

**Transparency as Code**: Audit logs and fee structures are baked into the UI, making corruption harder to hide and success easier to see.
